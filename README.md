# Optimizing-Revenue-Leakage-Profitability-in-the-Hospitality-Sector-

Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and mitigating revenue leakage in the hospitality sector while enhancing overall profitability through data-driven decision-making. By leveraging analytical frameworks, business KPIs, and forecasting models, the project simulates the role of a data analyst/consultant in addressing real-world challenges faced by mid-sized hotel chains.

The key objective was to extract actionable insights from raw operational data and translate them into pricing strategies, service optimizations, and profitability-enhancement recommendations.

Problem Statement
The hospitality industry frequently suffers from:
Unexplained revenue leakage due to inefficient pricing, unmanaged cancellations, and discounts.
Fluctuating profitability caused by seasonal demand variability.
Underutilization of ancillary services such as event spaces, spa, meals, and transport.
Lack of a systematic, data-backed framework to identify root causes and optimize strategies.

This project addresses these issues by combining data analytics, business logic, and strategic consulting recommendations.

Project Objectives
Develop a framework to diagnose and quantify revenue leakage.
Propose data-backed strategies for pricing, product improvement, and service optimization.
Justify recommendations using Week-on-Week forecasts and industry KPIs such as:
Revenue
RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
Occupancy %
ADR (Average Daily Rate)

Key Components & Deliverables
Data Analysis Module
Explored booking patterns: weekdays vs. weekends, room types, and seasonal variations.
Analyzed seasonal occupancy vs. revenue correlations.
Studied customer segmentation based on spending behavior and ancillary service usage (spa, meals, transport).

Root Cause Analysis
Identified underperforming services and room types.
Investigated cancellation reasons and impact of last-minute discounts.
Benchmarked performance against competitor pricing models and customer reviews.

Consulting Recommendations
Pricing Strategies: Dynamic pricing, bundling offers (couple packages, weekend getaways, corporate stays).
Service Optimization: Repurposing underutilized services (e.g., converting low-demand event-hosting spaces into co-working hubs during weekdays).
Operational Tweaks: Improved discount and cancellation policies to reduce leakage.

Business Justification
ROI and payback period analysis for proposed changes.
Scenario analysis (Best Case, Worst Case, Most Likely).
Final Deliverables
Interactive Dashboard showcasing KPIs and trends.
Consulting-Style Recommendation Report with business justifications.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Google Colab for analysis and reporting

Key Insights & Learnings
Insights
Event-hosting spaces were significantly underutilized during off-peak seasons, leading to avoidable revenue loss.
Ancillary services such as spas and transport showed low customer engagement, highlighting cross-selling opportunities.
Seasonal demand fluctuations revealed opportunities for dynamic, data-driven pricing models.

Recommendations
Convert underutilized event spaces into co-working hubs during low-demand periods, potentially increasing off-season revenue by ~15%.
Introduce bundled stay packages (weekend getaways, couple-centered offers) to increase occupancy %.
Optimize ancillary services through cross-selling and targeted promotions.

Learnings
Gained hands-on experience in framing data into consulting insights.
Learned to justify strategies using KPIs, ROI, and forecasting models.
Developed a consulting-style project structure â€” from root cause identification to strategic solution delivery.
